# Lane-Detection-and-Speed-Estimation
The project aims to detect lanes and estimate the speed of a vehicle using computer vision techniques. The repository contains the necessary files, including a Python script (cgv.py) and two video files (video1.mp4 and video2.mp4) for testing the project.

Main Function Points
Lane detection: The project uses computer vision techniques to detect the lanes on the road.
Speed estimation: The project estimates the speed of the vehicle based on the detected lanes.

Technology Stack
Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.
